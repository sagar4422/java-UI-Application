# java-UI-Application
This is a simple java application for user login to a website.
To create this application I have used jframe attributes like jbutton and jtextfield,
I have connected this application to mysql database by using phpmyadmin interface where table name is tbluser and further it has two columns like user and password
Here I am predefining the users that are allowed to get access to this application by inserting values corresponding to the user and password in the table.
Finally when an user enters the correct password application returs a java panal which says "You have successfully logged,welcome to the website" and if the entered username and password does no matched the it application displays an error message agin by using an java panal which says "Incorrect username and password".this is my first java application and I will upload more application to github soon,


Happy Coding....
